           <p><b>There are many things that inspired me to draw but out of that my parents were the biggest part. They are great artists themselves. My mother has painted a nice painting of Krishna and Radha that hangs in our living room. My father is a musician. He has been playing guitar since the past 25 years and is close to mastering it. Well nobody can master music because it is too big to be mastered. My mom inspired me to draw the art works I have displayed in the My Work section while my father inspired me to pursue piano.</b></p></section>
